# Overview
The Weather Check App is a responsive web application that allows users to check current weather conditions for any city worldwide. The app leverages a weather API to fetch real-time data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. Users can search for a location by city name, and the app displays the relevant weather information along with an icon representing the current weather.
# Technologies Used
1. HTML: The backbone of the app, HTML is used to structure the web pages, providing the layout for the input fields, buttons, and display areas for weather data.
2. CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) enhance the visual appeal of the app. CSS is used to style the layout, colors, fonts of the web application, ensuring a consistent look and feel across different devices and screen sizes.
3. JavaScript: JavaScript is the core of the app's functionality. It handles the logic for fetching data from the weather API, processing the user's input, and dynamically updating the HTML to display the retrieved weather information. JavaScript also manages user interactions, such as clicking buttons and handling errors gracefully.
